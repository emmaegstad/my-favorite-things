    <h2>Nicolas Cage: Good or Bad?</h2>
    <p>
      Since the dawn of his career, we have been trying to answer the question:
      Nicolas Cage - good or bad? His iconic roles are polarizing, giving us
      horror masterpieces like Mandy, but also... Ghost Rider 2. In the words of
      Dan Harmon, "He's not good or bad. He's Nicolas Cage. There are lots of
      actors with whom we get bored and discard, if there wasn't something for
      sale with Cage he would have been gone long ago. He's a riveting
      performer, you can't ignore him." He may not fall squarely into either
      camp, but he is, without a doubt, my favorite.
